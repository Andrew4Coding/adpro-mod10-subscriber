### a. What is *amqp*?
AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware. It enables the communication between different applications or services by sending messages through a broker, allowing for reliable and efficient message delivery.

### b. What does it mean? `guest:guest@localhost:5672` , what is the first guest, and what is the second guest, and what is localhost:5672 is for?
The first "guest" is the username, and the second "guest" is the password for authentication. "localhost:5672" refers to the address and port of the RabbitMQ server, where "localhost" indicates that the server is running on the same machine, and "5672" is the default port for AMQP connections.
